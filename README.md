#zZish Test - Marco Vanali

## My Outcome

![]()


I developed the Giphy Search web app following the given instructions.
It allow you to write one or more keywords and get the linkef Gifs from Giphy.
The gifs will appear as soon as you write your keywords without the need to press any button.

**For each page** are showed a maximum of 10 gifs and you can go to the next or previous page pressing the specific button.
